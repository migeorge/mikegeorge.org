# mikegeorge.org

This is a new version of mikegeorge.org written with Meteor.

Meteor is a reactive JavaScript framework that updates in real time and uses MongoDB.

Meteor has allowed me to create a site that I can edit from the front (only) page,
plus my edits will be pushed to everyone that is currently viewing the site instantly!
